# Example for Raspberry Pi Pico Analog to Digital Conversion

This is a port of the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK [DMA Capture Example](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/adc/dma_capture/dma_capture.c)
for reading data from the ADC.

The example has been modified to run under the Arduino IDE, including outputting the sampled waveform to the serial port.
